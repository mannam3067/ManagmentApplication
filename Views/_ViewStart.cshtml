    @*We use the Layout property to associate a view with a layout view.
        Without the _ViewStart.cshtml file, we set the Layout property in each and every view.
        To use a different layout file, all the individual views need to be updated
        It's a special file in ASP.NET Core MVC. 
        The code in this file is executed before the code in an individual view is executed
